Day 1: February 23, 2019

Today's Progress: I rejoined 100 Days of Code. It took me 2 hours to complete a lab on Object Relationships. 

Thoughts: I really wish my bootcamp used beter wording for the rspec tests! Sometimes the problem is so simple but I overthink often so it can be really stressful.

Day 2: February 24, 2019

Today's Progress: building classes and trying to parse filenames. 

Thoughts: Soon as I think I am getting things done, here comes another method for me to remember to get the tests to pass.
